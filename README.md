# Revised_Meta_Visualization
In this repository, we provide the instructions for our meta-visualization framework on three main stages:

Stage 1: Data acquisition and preparation tools

Stage 2: Data integration tools

Stage 3: Data visualization tools

We also provide a case study on precision agriculture to illustrate the different stages in one project.

Each repository contains a set of data, figures, and a notebook with detailed instructions.
