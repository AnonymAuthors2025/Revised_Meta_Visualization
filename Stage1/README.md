This subfolder (Stage 1) contains a notebook explaining the first stage of meta-visualization framework. It consists of Data Acquisition and Preparation tools.

The notebook uses direct urls to local map images and csv files. We provide an example of code using soil.png map, this map can be replaced by any other map for the local repository, such as irrigation.png, etage_bioclimatique.png, or wetland_classes.png.

The csv data associated with this folder represents examples of extracted data from web scraping, map scan extraction, and IoT sensors data.
